# The Milton Paper
Local Site Git Repo

## Introduction

Read [this][workflow]. It explains the workflow for creating a website on Github. Currently the "Master Branch is Deployable" rule is broken, since the site isn't deployable yet.

Also read the Github docs for setting up Github. They'll help.

Okay, let's get started.

## What? Local?

Yup. This site is set up to work locally, via [MAMP][mamp], [WAMP][wamp], or [LAMP (Wikipedia link since I don't understand Linux at all)][lamp]. The host is 'localhost', the MYSQL username and password are both 'root', and the database is named 'tmp'. If your local setup is not like this, IT WILL NOT WORK.

## Okay... what's with the Ruby stuff? And what's SCSS?

Sigh... Okay. Here. Scss and Sass are CSS preprocessing languages. You can find more about them at <http://sass-lang.com>. I use [Compass][compass], which is a set of mixins made for Sass.
